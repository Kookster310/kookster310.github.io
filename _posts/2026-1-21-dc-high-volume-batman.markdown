## Review

<div class="review-criteria">
<h3><span class="review-score-label">Soundscape / Production:</span> <span class="review-score">4.5/5</span></h3>
<p>As you'd expect (or at least hope for) from the official production of something as big as Batman, DC does a great job with production.</p>

<h3><span class="review-score-label">Voice Acting:</span> <span class="review-score">5/5</span></h3>
<p>Voice acting is really good as well. All are legit voice actors and I don't see a reason to give it anything under a 10</p>

<h3><span class="review-score-label">Writing:</span> <span class="review-score">4/5</span></h3>
<p>It's pretty easy to come up with a good script when you're adapting an already proven story.</p>

<h3><span class="review-score-label">Story:</span> <span class="review-score">4/5</span></h3>
<p>I was never the biggest superhero movie fan. Like some of them were okay, but I was always more into sci-fi. But this story is really good and it's easy want to listen to the next episode</p>
