# Fresh year, fresh thoughts

**Date:** January 21, 2026

2025 just ended and we're going into 2026. Cool.

I had recently been messing around with some new projects and decided to look at my 310networks.com website. It hadn't been updated since early 2018. Also cool.

For some reason I decided this was due for a reboot. I'm pretty sure someone said that if you like write your thoughts down somewhere it helps with your mental health or something? I'm not really sure, but it couldn't hurt.

I'm going to start writing more about my technical projects, but I also want to just write about whatever. Like maybe about baseball, or vent about politics, or review some audio dramas I like, I dunno. Just whatever comes to mind.

I think I'm going to add a sub-category called "bits" that I can just write a sentence or two about whatever I'm thinking about. Sometimes I think I get some sort of internal pressure to like write something super well thought out. It might be good to just write a single sentence for the week or whatever.

Anyways I guess I'll be back soon.
