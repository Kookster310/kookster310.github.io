## Review

I was never the biggest superhero movie fan. Like some of them were okay, but I was always more into sci-fi. This story however is really good and it's easy to want to listen to the next episode.
Dark and gritty story revolving around the early days of Batman. Overall a really good audio drama. Worth the listen especially if you are a fan of the superhero genre. Voice acting is very good as well. All are legit voice actors.
