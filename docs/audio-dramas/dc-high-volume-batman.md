# DC High Volume: Batman - Review

**Date:** January 21, 2026

## Overview

An official adaptation of the comics Batman: Year One by writer Frank Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli, and Batman: The Long Halloween, and Batman: Dark Victory by writer Jeph Loeb and artist Tim Sale.

## Review

### Soundscape / Production — 4.5/5

As you'd expect (or at least hope for) from the official production of something as big as Batman, DC does a great job with production.

### Voice Acting — 5/5

Voice acting is really good as well. All are legit voice actors and I don't see a reason to give it anything under a 10.

### Writing — 4/5

It's pretty easy to come up with a good script when you're adapting an already proven story.

### Story — 4/5

I was never the biggest superhero movie fan. Like some of them were okay, but I was always more into sci-fi. But this story is really good and it's easy want to listen to the next episode.

**Final Score:** 17/20 (87.5)
