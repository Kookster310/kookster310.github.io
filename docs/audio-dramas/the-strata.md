# The Strata

**Date:** February 2nd, 2026

## Overview

In a dystopian city, an ageing courier is forced to go into business with an underworld ganglord in order to pay for the treatment that keeps him alive. 
The Strata is a Beyond the Dark production.

## Review

Badass cyborg courier who delivers goods in dangerous situations in a cyberpunk dystopian future. Fun listen. It's had a lot of seasons, so it is worth a re-listen.

### Soundscape / Production — 4/5

Well produced, probably one of the stronger points of the audio drama.

### Voice Acting — 3/5

Voice acting is pretty solid. Some characters are better than others. 3 seems fair

### Writing — 3.5/5

Mark R. Healy, creator of the Strata, does a good job of painting a picture. Really goes for the whole cyberpunk/bladerunner vibe, and I dig it. He also does another podcast I listen to, Road of Shadows, which is pretty solid as well.

### Story — 8/10

I actually really enjoy the stories from the Strata. They are up to like 13 seasons or something now so I'm probably due for a relisten. From what I can remember 

**Final Score:** 18.5/25 (74%)
