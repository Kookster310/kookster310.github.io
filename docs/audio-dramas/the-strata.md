## Review

Badass cyborg courier who delivers goods in dangerous situations in a cyberpunk dystopian future. Well produced, probably one of the stronger points of the audio drama. The voice acting is solid, though some characters are better than others. 
Mark R. Healy, creator of the Strata, does a good job of painting a picture. Really goes for the whole cyberpunk/bladerunner vibe, and I dig it. He also does another podcast I listen to, Road of Shadows, which is pretty solid as well.
Fun listen, I really enjoy the stories from the universe created here. It's had a lot of seasons, so it might be time for a re-listen.
